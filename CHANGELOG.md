### Features Detail

#### Digital Footprint Analysis
The system analyzes candidate's digital presence across multiple platforms:
- Profile information (bio, followers, engagement)
- Content analysis (posts, comments, shares)
- Sentiment analysis of all content
- Risk flag identification
- Positive indicator detection

#### AI Scoring Algorithm
Weighted scoring system:
- Sentiment: 30%
- Professionalism: 25%
- Digital Ethics: 25%
- Social Engagement: 20%

Risk Factors:
- Hate speech content (Critical severity)
- Excessive profanity (High severity)
- High negativity ratio (Medium severity)
- Political activism (Low severity - requires manual review)

Positive Indicators:
- Clean digital record
- Professional presence
- Positive communication
- Good social engagement

#### Mock Scraping System
Current version uses mock data for social media scraping to comply with platform terms of service and demonstrate system capabilities. Production deployment should:
- Implement proper API integrations with OAuth
- Respect platform rate limits
- Follow terms of service
- Obtain necessary permissions

### Technical Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI 0.104+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+
- TextBlob for sentiment analysis
- scikit-learn for ML
- BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping

**Frontend:**
- React 18+
- Material-UI 5+
- React Router 6+
- Axios for API calls
- Recharts for data visualization

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx (for production)
- Gunicorn (ASGI server)

### Development

#### Testing
- Backend unit tests with pytest
- API integration tests
- Service layer tests
- Mock data for testing

#### Database
- PostgreSQL relational database
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Migration support ready (Alembic)
- Seed data script included

### Known Limitations

1. **Social Media Scraping**: Currently uses mock data. Real implementation requires:
   - Official API access
   - OAuth authentication
   - Rate limiting compliance
   - Legal approval

2. **Authentication**: Basic structure in place, needs full implementation for production

3. **NLP Model**: Uses basic English NLP model. Indonesian language model recommended for production

4. **Performance**: Not optimized for high-volume concurrent requests

### Future Enhancements

Planned for future releases:
- Real-time social media integration via official APIs
- Advanced Indonesian NLP models
- Machine learning model training on historical data
- Behavioral assessment simulations
- Integration with SIASN and other government systems
- Mobile application (Flutter)
- Advanced reporting and export features
- Email notifications
- Audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant support

### Security Notes

⚠️ **Important for Production:**
- Change all default passwords and secret keys
- Enable HTTPS/SSL
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Enable database backups
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Conduct security audit
- Comply with UU PDP (Indonesian Data Protection Law)

### Compliance
